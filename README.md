# CJRCmdlets
PowerShell Examples
This project demonstrates basic knowledge of PowerShell 5.1 (the version installed on all Windows 10 instances)
The .NET solution implements a custom Cmdlet that returns the # of days in the past that the creation date of each file passed in from the pipeline. This could be used for example to delete or archive files older than that many days
The subfolder AuxFiles under the Project contains a .ps1 PowerShell script that demonstrates use of PowerShell and the Cmdlet.
